<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
  MARS is a browser-based
  <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audience_response#Audience_response_systems">
  Audience Response System</a> dedicated to e.g. teachers,
  moderators to support their courses to evaluate knowledge, assess opinions or
  illustrate concepts, or just for fun!
</p>
<p>
  MARS is published under the GNU GPLv3 open source licence and is free. Polls
  remain completely under your control and can be shared if, and only if,
  you choose to do so.
</p>
<p>
  MARS puts the control on the poll material back into your own hands, as opposed
  to many online commercial products that take away from you the ownership as well as
  the control over your intellectual property, in order to make profits.
</p>

<h2>Vocabulary</h2>
<p>
  MARS uses following concepts:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>the poll</li>
  <p>
    The poll is a set of questions. A poll can be created and edited in the system
    and
    can furthermore be exported/imported (easy JSON files) and shared e.g. via simple
    email.
  </p>
  <li>poll types</li>
  <p>
    Polls have a <i>type</i> that is determined at creation time depending
    on the intention of the poll author. Two types are
    defined:
    <ul>
      <li>the <i>quiz</i> type</li>
      <p>
        The quiz type of poll is preferred for evaluation purposes. Results
        will display falsy/truthy answers and scores that
        can be directly used for rating purposes.
      </p>
      <li>the <i>poll</i> type</li>
      <p>
        The poll type of poll (sorry for redundancy) is preferred for
        opinion assessment or situations where evaluation and scores are
        not relevant. Results will just display choices without scoring.
      </p>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <li>the session</li>
  <p>
    The <i>session</i> is the live execution of a poll. Sessions consist of
    question display and score/result evaluation. Sessions are stored and can be
    retrieved and displayed later for testimony purposes. Moreover, sessions
    can be re-played, providing cumulative result recording among
    multiple student groups.
  </p>
  <li>the session play modes</li>
    <p>
      Sessions can have one of two <i>play modes</i> determined at session start time :
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        the <i>normal mode</i> where students will see all
        questions simultaneously on their client application, thus focusing
        attention on their
        terminals. The teacher screen will meanwhile display results, scores and answers
        in real time. Session duration is under teacher's manual control.
      </li>
      <li>
        the <i>group mode</i> where the teacher screen will display the questions
        one at a time, so that student attention will be focused collectively
        on the teacher screen. Their client application will only display
        choice means for one question at a time. Realtime aspects are in the
        foreground and question display duration as well as session duration are
        automated and determined by the poll author during question editing.
        Results and scores will be displayed at the end of the
        session.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <p></p>
  <li>roles and software applications</li>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>the <i>teacher role</i> relies on the usage of the <i>MARS manager
          application</i> (yes correct, actually this page is part of it).
        </li>
        <li>the <i>student role</i> is supported by the <i>MARS client application
          </i>. The URL of this application is displayed at session start time for
          all to see.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Poll management</h2>
  <p>
    Polls are managed via the <i>Polls</i> top menu bar option. The screen will
    display a list of all available polls in your local system. The action icons
    associated to any given poll will determine following activities :

  <h3>Poll creation</h3>
  <p>
    To create a new poll, click on the green button labelled "create a new poll"
    at the top of the list. A pop-up will appear where you can fill in the title
    of the new poll, as well as choose (mandatory) the poll type (see definition
    above : quiz or poll type). This will initialize a new, empty poll.
  </p>

  <h3>Poll edition</h3>
  <p>
    The poll editor allows, much like a slide sorter in presentation software,
    to add questions, to modify question ordering and to delete questions.
