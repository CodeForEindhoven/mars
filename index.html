    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      MARS is a client-server
      <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audience_response#Audience_response_systems">
      Audience Response System</a> dedicated to e.g. teachers,
      moderators to support their courses to evaluate knowledge, assess opinions or
      illustrate concepts, or just for fun!
    </p>
    <p>
      MARS is published under the GNU GPLv3 open source licence and is free. Polls
      remain completely under your control and can be shared if, and only if,
      you choose to do so.
    </p>
    <p>
      MARS puts the control on the poll material back into your own hands, as opposed
      to many online commercial products that take away from you the ownership as well as
      the control over your intellectual property.
    </p>

    <h2>Screenshots</h2>
    <p>
      The UI design of MARS is inspired by contemporary flat looks.
      It uses the w3.css kit, font awesome icons and a number of customizations.

    <h2>Vocabulary</h2>
    <p>
      MARS uses following concepts:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>the poll</li>
      <p>
        The poll is a set of questions. A poll can be created and edited in the system
        and
        can furthermore be exported/imported (easy JSON files) and shared e.g. via simple
        email.
      </p>
      <li>poll types</li>
      <p>
        Polls have a <i>type</i> that is determined at creation time depending
        on the intention of the poll author. Two types are
        defined:
        <ul>
          <li>the <i>quiz</i> type</li>
          <p>
            The quiz type of poll is preferred for evaluation purposes. Results
            will display falsy/truthy answers and scores that
            can be directly used for rating purposes.
          </p>
          <li>the <i>poll</i> type</li>
          <p>
            The poll type of poll (sorry for redundancy) is preferred for
            opinion assessment or situations where evaluation and scores are
            not relevant. Results will just display choices without scoring.
          </p>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <li>the session</li>
      <p>
        The <i>session</i> is the live execution of a poll. Sessions consist of
        question display and score/result evaluation. Sessions are stored and can be
        retrieved and displayed later for testimony purposes. Moreover, sessions
        can be re-played, providing cumulative result recording among
        multiple student groups.
      </p>
      <li>the session play modes</li>
        <p>
          Sessions can have one of two <i>play modes</i> determined at session start time :
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            the <i>normal mode</i> where students will see all
            questions simultaneously on their client application, thus focusing
            attention on their
            terminals. The teacher screen will meanwhile display results, scores and answers
            in real time. Session duration is under teacher's manual control.
          </li>
          <li>
            the <i>group mode</i> where the teacher screen will display the questions
            one at a time, so that student attention will be focused collectively
            on the teacher screen. Their client application will only display
            choice means for one question at a time. Realtime aspects are in the
            foreground and question display duration as well as session duration are
            automated and determined by the poll author during question editing.
            Results and scores will be displayed at the end of the
            session.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <p></p>
      <li>roles and software applications</li>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>the <i>teacher role</i> relies on the usage of the <i>MARS manager
              application</i>.
            </li>
            <li>the <i>student role</i> is supported by the <i>MARS client application
              </i>. The URL of this application is displayed at session start time for
              all to see.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Poll management</h2>
      <p>
        Polls are managed via the <i>Polls</i> top menu bar option. The screen will
        display a list of all available polls in your local system. The action icons
        associated to any given poll will determine following activities :
      </p>
      <img class="myimage" src="images/polls-fig1-full.jpg" alt="polls fig 1">

      <h3>Poll creation</h3>
      <p>
        To create a new poll, click on the green button labelled "create a new poll"
        at the top of the list. A pop-up will appear where you can fill in the title
        of the new poll, as well as choose (mandatory) the poll type (see definition
        above : quiz or poll type). This will initialize a new, empty poll that will
        be listed in the poll list. To create questions for this new poll, simply
        click on its "edit" icon to launch the poll editor (see below).
      </p>

      <h3>Poll edition</h3>
      <p>
        The poll editor allows, much like a slide sorter in presentation software,
        to add questions, to modify question ordering and to delete questions.
        Each question composing the poll is depicted along with a number of action
        buttons :
      </p>
      <img class="myimage" src="images/polls-fig2-full.jpg" alt="polls editor fig 1"
      style="max-width: 60%"/>
      <p class="w3-small w3-center">
        - the poll editor -
      </p>

      <h4>Add questions</h4>
      <p>
        To add a new question, click on the "add question" button on the top of the
        poll editor. This will lauch the question editor with a new question (see below).
      </p>
      <h4>Move questions</h4>
      <p>
        To move questions use the "move-up/down" buttons as seen on the screenshot
        above. Their effect is to move the related question one slot up or down
        in the list of questions.
      </p>
      <h4>Delete questions</h4>
      <p>
        The DELETE button will remove the related question from the list. Be careful
        as there is no coming back.
      </p>
      <h4>Edit questions</h4>
      <p>
        The EDIT button will lauch the question editor with the related question (see below).
      </p>

      <h3>Question edition</h3>
      <p>
        The question editor allows to completely define all aspects of a question,
        including all texts, optionally an image illustration etc. All actions
        on the editor are immediately reflected in a live preview.
      </p>
      <p>
        Any question can have one of two available layouts: one column and two
        columns. The two-colum layout allows to fit in additional text
        and/or an image. Images are hosted externally (e.g. by image hosting sites).
        More multimedia contents may be available in future
        versions (sound, video).
      </p>
      <p>
        The different options and actions are best explained by a
        picture as well as personal experiments:

      </p>

      <h3>Poll play</h3>
      <p>
        Reminder: polls can be played (i.e. run in front of a student group) in one of two
        modes explained above: the group mode and the normal mode. The process of
        poll play is called a session.
      </p>
      <p>
        To start a new session with a given poll, see fig. 1 above : two buttons
        allow to start a session in one of the two modes.
      </p>

    <h2>Session lifecycle</h2>
      <p>
        A session goes through following states:
        <ol>
          <li><b>waiting</b>: this is the initial state.
              The session is started,
              but waits for the participants to register on this session with their
              terminals (i.e. smartphones). Of course this screen should be visible
              to all via a videoprojector. The registration URL is indicated for
              all to see., as well as the session id and a PIN used for client identification.
              The status zone on the right shows in
              realtime the number of enrolled students. When all students are enrolled, the
              teacher can run the session by a click on the green start button:
              <br><br>
              <img class="myimage" src="images/screenshots-session-fig2.png" alt="session fig 1"
              style="max-width: 70%"/>
              <p class="w3-small w3-center">
                - the session in waiting state (here, in normal mode) -
              </p>
          </li>
          <li><b>running</b>: this is the live execution of the session. Its shape
            depends on the session mode:
            <ul>
              <li><b>in normal mode</b> the screen will stay like the picture
                above, showing in realtime the results and scores of the students.
                The teacher can hide the result area in order to avoid student
                distraction. The students receive all poll questions at once on
                their terminals. Students can actuate their answers as often as
                they like. In normal mode the poll timing is entirely under
                the teacher's control. A click on the red stop button will
                terminate the run, the session reaching the "finished" state.
              </li>
              <li><b>in group mode</b>, on the other hand, the session is
                completely automated. The screen as showed above disappears and
                instead, a countdown begins, after which the questions are
                cast one at a time (see fig. 4 above) for the programmed duration
                (see question editor above). After all questions have been cast,
                the session terminates by showing the results. Its state becomes
                "finished".
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><b>finished</b> is the state of a session having terminated
            normally. Its results are stored and can be viewed later.
          </li>
          <li><b>cancelled</b> is the state of a session having been terminated
            manually by the teacher. Although such a session is recorded and
            can even be restarted, its stored results are perhaps incomplete.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <p>
        Any type of session in any mode is stored and can be viewed later, but also can be
        restarted by means of the Session management interface (see below). This
        allows to conduct a given poll among differents student groups, cumulating
        the results.
      </p>


    <h2>Session management</h2>

    <p>
      Sessions are managed by means of the Session list interface, attained by the
      "Sessions" button on the top menu bar.
    </p>
    <h3>Session list</h3>
    <p>
      The following picture summarizes actions related to the Session list:
      <br><br>
      <img class="myimage" src="images/sessionlist-fig1-full.jpg" alt="session fig 2"
      style="max-width: 70%"/>
    </p>

    <h3>Session results</h3>
    <p>
      Session results are available a) after a normal run in normal or group mode, the screen
      shows already available results as calculated by the server;  b) when selected
      in the Session list through the "view" icon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Session results have three parts from top to bottom:
      <ol>
        <li><b>the score result table</b> showing the results and scores. In a quiz
          type of poll, results are red/green per person/per question and an individual
          score is readily available. In a poll type, results are neutral.
        </li>
        <li><b>the raw data table</b> which is hidden by default, but can be
          viewed to discuss individual answers if so desired.
        </li>
        <li><b>the charts</b> showing the results graphically, which is particularly
          useful in the poll type.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
      The following picture shows a portion of the charts part in a real case:
      <br><br>
      <img class="myimage" src="images/screenshots-session-fig4.png" alt="session fig 4"
      style="max-width: 70%"/>
    </p>
    <br><br>

    <h2>User management</h2>

    <h3>General principles</h3>

    <p>
      As of writing (v. 0.87) user management is simplified. Two user roles exist:
      <ul>
        <li><b>the administrator</b> who has the specific task of validating
          new "vanilla" users. The validation process involves a) the candidate
          user to register through the <i>new user registration</i> screen;
          b) the system to send an email notification to the administrator in
          which two links are provided, one for acceptance and one for refusal;
          and c) in case of acceptance, the system to send a positive email notification
          to the candidate. In the present version <u>the administrator is
          immutable</u> (except if you cheat a bit in the database :-)) and is the
          person having initiated the first login in the system.
        </li>
        <li><b>vanilla users</b> who have no further responsibilities.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      In all cases the system can only be used by persons having been through the
      above approval process (and by the admin himself, of course) and authenticate
      locally. This strategy
      isolates MARS from the many possible external authentification methods (LDAP etc.).
    </p>

    <h3>Security considerations</h3>
    <p>
      Due to the particular http interface between clients and server in the MARS
      system, man-in-the-middle attacks must be avoided by installing the system
      on a HTTPS server.
    </p>
    <p>
      MARS never sends out passwords in cleartext.
    </p>


    <h2>Techie section</h2>
    <p>
      MARS is a client-server application based on Angular (client side) and PHP
      (server side). The database is PostGresql. The editor is Atom.
